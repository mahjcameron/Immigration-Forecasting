Welcome to my Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Forecasting and Dashboard. Where I utilized open source immigration data from the government of Canada to both forecast immigration and built a dashboard to more easily explore the data

## How to set up files

3. Click on the Data Tab -> Get Data -> Data Source Settings -> Change Source and then the folder in whicn you downloaded the raw csv
4. From there you should have full access to the data
5. If you want to see how the data was cleaned and formatted to make it easier to read
